📌 Problem Statement
Real estate prices in Bangalore vary widely across locations and property characteristics. This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict house prices accurately, helping both buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

🔧 Technologies Used
Python 🐍

Jupyter Notebook 📓

Scikit-learn 🤖

Pandas & NumPy 📊

Matplotlib & Seaborn 📈

🧠 Model Overview
Model Type: Linear Regression

Input Features:

Total square feet (total_sqft)

Number of bathrooms (bath)

Number of BHKs (bhk)

Location (one-hot encoded using over 240+ unique Bangalore localities from columns.json)

Target Variable: Price (in lakhs)

🚀 How to Use
Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/bangalore-home-price-prediction.git
cd bangalore-home-price-prediction
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook ML_Project.ipynb
Use the trained model (banglore_home_prices_model.pickle) for prediction by loading it in a Python script or Flask app.

🧪 Sample Input for Prediction
python
Copy
Edit
import pickle
import json
import numpy as np

# Load model and columns
model = pickle.load(open('banglore_home_prices_model.pickle', 'rb'))
data_columns = json.load(open('columns.json'))['data_columns']

def predict_price(location, sqft, bath, bhk):
    x = np.zeros(len(data_columns))
    x[0] = sqft
    x[1] = bath
    x[2] = bhk
    if location.lower() in data_columns:
        loc_index = data_columns.index(location.lower())
        x[loc_index] = 1
    return model.predict([x])[0]

predict_price('1st phase jp nagar', 1000, 2, 2)
📈 Future Scope
Add web UI using Flask or Django

Integrate map-based location selection

Improve accuracy using advanced models like XGBoost or Random Forest

Include amenities like parking, lift, security as features

Add model retraining with updated real estate data
